How do I interpret user needs and implement them into a program? How does creating “user stories” help with this?
  Interpreting user needs fundamentally is quite simple; it's knowing what users expect from a software product or what you want to see to make your life easier while using said software. 
  To do this, we do something called system analysis, which helps identify and define user needs. The system analysis process involves gathering feedback from users of the software so that they can provide insights into what did and didn't work and what they believe would be beneficial to the program.
  Once the feedback is received and the Scrum team understands that feedback, the Developers can go back and modify the code or change it based on the user's wants and needs.
  
How do I approach developing programs? What agile processes do I want to incorporate into my future development work?

  I approach developing programs like most things in life: Backward planning. I know what the end goal is.  From there, I look at what steps are needed to achieve my end goal, like planning a trip. For example, I know I want to go to Disney World, and that's my goal. I need to purchase a flight, a rental car, and a hotel to get there.
  Then I need to decide what is a good flight time, one that is early enough to make sure I can check into the hotel and get the rental car but also allow time for me to get my family ready for the trip. I need to determine the best time to pack; I also need to make sure the clothes I want to bring are 
  clean and ready to go. I also need to ensure I give work a good heads up that I will not be in the office. I make far fewer mistakes with backward planning than with any other form of planning I have tried. In the future, I think having Scrum meetings daily is a great idea; even though I wouldn't say I like meetings, getting everybody on the
  same page has been a massive help in keeping this moving and organized.

What does it mean to be a good team member in software development?
  There is no singular answer to this question. Still, the best answer I can think of is the things that make a good team member in software development is the same thing that makes good teammates in everything: Know your job and know it well, take pride in your work, Openly communicate, and understand you don't know everything and its okay to ask for help, weather that's asking for an extension or just a simple nudge in the right direction.
